# Personal_Project_2
This project is just to explore GUI and get used to Graphics class in java. I will use the techniques to integrate graphics into P-1 UNO game in te next project. In this project, I will make a graphic of 10 cards arranged on a frame randomly where I can click an arnitrary number (btw 1 and 10). Then, it will return the sum of the selected cards on the frame. I will win if the sum is between 30 ~ 40.
